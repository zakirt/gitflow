        <h2>General</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All feature branches are created off the master branch.</li>
            <li>Techincal tasks that do not require QA (i.e., unit tests, README updates, etc...) are always merged directly
                into the master branch.</li>
            <li>Feature branches that are non-technical tasks, can be merged directly into master after QA approval, or via the optional QA branch.</li>
            <li>Releases are marked using <b>release tags</b> in the master branch.</li>
            <li>Rebasing is favored over merging.</li>
            <li>QA/feature branches are merged into master via pull requests. <b>Squash and merge</b> strategy is used to merge the branches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>QA branch</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Is optional and is created off the master branch</li>
            <li>Is used in cases where multiple feature branches need to be tested in unison prior to release.</li>
            <li>Will be deleted after being merged into the master branch.</li>
            <li>Will have feature branches merged into it via pull requests (squash and merge strategy is used).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Releases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All feature branches must be rebased with master after a new release tag is created.</li>
            <li>Release tags are used for build/deploy jobs (i.e., Jenkins).</li>
        </ul>
